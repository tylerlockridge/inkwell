# Inkwell

Android app for capturing notes/tasks directly to an Obsidian vault inbox via a REST API.
Communicates with the Obsidian Dashboard Desktop server running on a DigitalOcean droplet.

<!-- QUICK-RESUME-UPDATED: 2026-02-26 -->
## Quick Resume
**Last Active:** 2026-02-26
**Current Phase:** Newly separated from Obsidian-Dashboard-Desktop monolith
**Current Task:** Verify standalone build works after separation
**Blockers:** None
**Next Action:** Run `./gradlew assembleRelease` to verify build. Address audit findings: add instrumented tests, refactor CaptureScreen/MainActivity into smaller composables.

### Audit 2026-02-26 — Codex (GPT-4o)
Architecture 8, Code Quality 7, Testing 5, Security 7, Performance 6, Documentation 5 → **6.3/10**
- Zero instrumented tests (Espresso/Compose UI tests)
- CaptureScreen.kt + MainActivity.kt too large (1000+ lines) — split into smaller composables
- `allowBackup` was true (FIXED: now false)
